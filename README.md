# Diabetes-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning-Models
The dataset is a real dataset on Pima Indian diabetes data that consist of several medical predictor (independent) variables and one target (dependent) variable, Outcome. Independent variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level,glucose level,level of Bloodpressure, skin thickness age, and so on.   To predict Diabetes on diagonstic, I have used several models such as Logistic Regression, KNN Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Classifier and Gradient Boosting Classifier. Moreover, the important part of building any machine learning model is Exploratory Data analysis(EDA) that has been described in this project shortly.
