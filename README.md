# Diabetes-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning-Models
The dataset is a real dataset on Pima Indian diabetes data that consist of several medical predictor. The medical reports include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, glucose level, level of Blood pressure, skin thickness age, and so on. To predict Diabetes on diagnostic, used several models such as Logistic Regression, KNN Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Classifier and Gradient Boosting Classifier.
